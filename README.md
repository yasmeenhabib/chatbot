The bot shows a series of predefined messages that users can click on to get specific responses.

Users can also type their messages to interact with the bot. The bot will respond based on the content of the user's message.

To trigger the "Tell me a joke" feature, the user can click on the predefined message "Tell me a joke."

To get the weather information, the user can click on the predefined message "A weather bot" and provide the city name when prompted.
